The characteristic function $\phi$ of a random variable $X \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is 

$$
\phi(\omega) = \text{E}[e^{i \omega^\top X}]
$$

The characteristic function can easily be related to the [[moment-generating-function]] according to

$$
m(\omega) = \phi(-i \omega)
$$
## Properties

The characteristic function:

* crosses 1 at 0: $\phi(0) = 1$
* is in the interval $[-1,1]$: $-1 < \phi(\omega) < 1$ 
* is uniformly continuous
