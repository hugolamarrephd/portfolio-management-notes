# Quantitative Portfolio Management Notes
Welcome to my personal repository of notes on Quantitative Portfolio Management.
This collection is organized using the Zettelkasten system,
a method designed to enhance information retrieval through interconnected note-taking.
The aim is to gather my knowledge related to quantitative portfolio management in a single place.
It's important to note that the scope of this project is not limited to portfolio management,
and may extend to purely mathematical (e.g. statistics, machine learning, etc.) subjects relevant to the field.

## Repository Structure

This repository employs a **flat folder structure** to minimize barriers to writing and note retrieval.
Each note is a standalone document, and notes may reference each other.

### Links and Tags

We use the following convention for tagging markdown documents:
```
---
tags:
  - allocation
  - mean-variance
---
```
and we link notes using the double-brackets convention, e.g.
```
[[mean-variance-optimization]]
```

To easily navigate links or search tags, we recommend using a note-taking markdown app such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
